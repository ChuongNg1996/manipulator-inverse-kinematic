# Manipulator - Inverse Kinematic
A simple implementation of inverse kinematic for robot manipulator
(Building)

## Project Description
The project presents a simple implementation of inverse kinematic on robot manipulator with pseudoinverse Jacobian matrix

The project uses: 
* [ROS Framework](http://wiki.ros.org/) (on Ubuntu) to alleviate concurrency management and module communication.
* [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) with [UR3 Manipulator](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot) as testing subject.
